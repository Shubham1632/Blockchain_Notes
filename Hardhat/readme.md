Hardhat

Hardhat (Advanced) 

steps to start-
(using yarn) 
-  yarn init
- yarn add --dev hardhat 
	- (--dev - dependancies are only require to develop the project otherwise they are require to run it)
- ( npm ~ yarn && npx ~ yarn)
- yarn hardhat 
	- creates a new hardhat project) 
- hardhat compile (compiles the project)
	- generate cache and artifacts
	-  when your run the deployment script in future, hardhat automatically recompile the project
- JavaScript objects are very imp

---

Hardhat-
- some of the node modules are starting with @ because they are scoping the organisation that made it
	- i.e. @angular means the package is developed by the angular team
	- simillary @nomiclabs ~ team who build hardhat
- (hardhat.config.js) - entry point for all the script 
	- whenever we use hardhat command in the command line it first looks into the hardhat.config file
- hre ---> hardhat runtime environment
	- can use as function parameter and variable and
	- can access almost everything with it
	- give it a try
- to delete artifacts and cache ---> ( yarn hardhat clean )
- to compile the contracts ----> ( yarn hardhat compile )


---
prettier-
- (yarn add --dev prettier prettier-plugin-solidity)
- make a new file - (.prettierrc)
- specify the customization in it

whenever using .env variables always assign some or ( | | ) to it 
so that hardhat will not get irritate

in javascript-  (not related)
- ==   --> no type conversion 
- ===   --> check type conversion

---

Deployment script-
- calling Main function- look out later
- defining main function -
	- add a getContractFactory ---> (await ethers.gerContractFactory("<contractName>");
	- after getting the contract deploy the contract
	- deploy---> (await <contract_factory_name>.deploy() )
	- to wait until contract get deployed --> ( await  <deployed_constant_name>.deployed() )
	- hardhat have its own network to get deployed and we can directly deploy the contract on them using following command ---> (yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js )
	- or either you can define your own network in hardhat.confing.js file 
- configuring your own network:
	- include dotenv
	- import the 1. private key of your account and 2. rpc url to the testnet
	- add networks in module.exports
	- add your network name as a entity
	- then add
		- 1. your rpc url as url,
		- 2. your private key int an array named as accounts,
		- 3.chainId of testnet.
	- then to run it on network ---> ( yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name> )
- verifying your deployment- 
	- there is a etherscan api to verify the code 
	- also there is built in plugin in the hardhat for etherscan verification 
	- (yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ehterscan)
	- adds functionality of veify with the terminal mannually 
	- in the verify function 
```
await run("verify:verify", {address:<contract_address, constructorArguments: [],})
```

- interacting with the contract -
	- we can interact with contract with the constant that we made on deployment of contract factory
	- const contract = await contract_factory.deploy();
	- now with this contract variable we can access the contract functions
	- const favnum = await contract.retriveFavNo();
		- will return the current favorite no.
	- we can also add and manipulate with various functions of the contract
- hardhat-deploy
	- tool to deploy and test the code

---

- tasks-
	- have to import task - const {task} = require("hardhat/config")
	- syntax -
		- task("<task_name>", "task_description").setAction( <some anonymous functions completing the task> )
		- do not forget to add the task to hardhat.config file.
		- after that run yarn hardhat to check if the task is there or not 

---

- run account on localhost- 
	- hardhat also provides functioality to run over https
	- just have to run the command --->  ( yarn hardhat node )
	- will provide bunch of accounts and a endpoint (https) 
	- use the endpoint and chaind-id 31337 in the networks so that you can acces the localhost
	- but once we started the node we have to continiously run it

---

- Hardhat console-  
	- hardhat provides its own console to work on 
	- just run ---> ( yarn hardhat console --network <network_name> )
	- we can run everything on the console that we do on deployment script
	- 9:28:45

---

- Testing- 
	- tests are very important aspects in developing a dapp
	- we can also do testing in the solidity itself ( as it is more closer to the blockchain )   but many developers prefer doing it on modern programming language like javascript or python 
	- syntax-
		- describe("<name>", <function> )   ---- (can have multiple describes)
		- inside function-
			- one beforeEach() and multiple it()
			- pass a function (anonymous)to beforeEach 
				- deploy the contract in that function (async)
				- also write the prerequisite code for the testing
			- int it() -
				- give a name as first parameter
				- pass an anonymous function as a second parameter (async)
				- in function you can use assert or expect
				- ex.  ( assert.equal(currval,expectedval) ) ---> will pass the test if both of them are equal 
				- ex. expext(currval).to.equal(expected)   -----> will do same as assert but prefer assert over it
				- can also use grep command to specifically run the test that we wanted
					- yarn hardhat test --grep <keyword> 
				- can specify it.only() to run that test only
	- Hardhat-gas-reporter-
		- install it and define it in hardhat.config and module.export of hardhat.config
		- make a object called gasReporter in module .export
			- mark enabled : true so that it will automatically run every time
			- we can output it to a file using ( outputFile: "<file_name.txt>" ) 
			- can specify the currency ---> ( currency: "INR" )
			- get the coinmarketcap api and add it 
			- also can specify the type of blockchain to test ---> ( token: "MATIC" )
	- solidity-coverage-
		- shows the amount of code covered in the testing
		- add it through yarn
		- add to config as usual
		- creates the coverage folder and the coverage.json file
		- 10:00:40s
 
---

- Deploy_folder-
	- make a deploy folder and a deploy file in js
	- get the accounts from get named accounts
	- run the deploy function in module.exports
		- so we can access the deployed contracts via importing the deploy file
		- 
	- run the deploy function --->
		- const contract= await deploy( "<contract_name>", {from : <deployer>} ,  args: [ <arguments to pass], log: true); 
	- we can specify the deployer in namedAccounts object in the hardhat.config
	- also we can use the namedAccounts object via getNamedAccount
	- arguments are passed if the contract have constructor and need the arguments to deploy the contract
	- if you run a node in local network the hardhat will automatically deploy your contracts to the local network
